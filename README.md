Backbone + Ponegap Boilerplate
==============================

This boilerplate template is a fork of the popular Backbone Boilerplate specifically aimed at PhoneGap projects.

Instead of running your project in a webserver, this template focusses on being run through the file protocol. As such, all urls and imports are made relative.
